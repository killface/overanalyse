Now, let's walk through how to create a menu using this approach:

Define your menu structure:

In the sidebarConfig.js file, you define the structure of your menu using the homeConfig, civIdleConfig, or any other configurations you need.
Each configuration is an array of objects, where each object represents a group in the menu.
Each group has a header and an array of items.
Each item has a text (displayed in the menu), a path (for navigation), and an icon (imported from Material-UI or your custom icons).


Map configurations to routes:

In the sidebarConfig object, you map these configurations to specific routes or route prefixes.
For example, home: homeConfig means the home configuration will be used for the root path.
CivIdle: civIdleConfig means the CivIdle configuration will be used for any path starting with '/cividle'.


Use the useSidebar hook:

This hook determines which configuration to use based on the current path.
It checks for specific prefixes first (like '/cividle'), then falls back to the first segment of the path.
If no matching configuration is found, it defaults to the home configuration.


Render the Sidebar:

The Sidebar component uses the useSidebar hook to get the current configuration and path.
It then renders the menu structure, creating headers, groups, and items as defined in the configuration.
Each item is rendered as a link with an icon and text.
The current path is used to highlight the active item.



To add a new menu or modify an existing one:

Create a new configuration in sidebarConfig.js (e.g., terraformingMarsConfig).
Add it to the sidebarConfig object with the appropriate key (e.g., TerraformingMars: terraformingMarsConfig).
Update the useSidebar hook if you need special routing logic for this new menu.

This approach allows you to easily manage different menu configurations for different parts of your application while keeping the sidebar component itself relatively simple and reusable.
